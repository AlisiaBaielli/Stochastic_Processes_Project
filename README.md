In this repository, you can find the individual project for the 'Stochastic Processes and Simulation in Natural Sciences' course held at Bocconi University by Professor Giacomo Zanella.

This project aims to simulate the Hopfield network as described in the paper "Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities" by John Hopfield.
