In this repository, you can find the individual project for the 'Stochastic Processes and Simulation in Natural Sciences' course held at Bocconi University by Professor Giacomo Zanella.

This project aims to simulate the Hopfield network as described in the Hopfield's paper.

- Hopfield-1982-Neural-Networks.pdf: Seminal paper by John Hopfield titled "Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities.".
- Stochastic_Processes_Project.ipynb: Notebook for the simulations of the project. It outlines the objectives, methodology, and results of simulating the Hopfield network.
